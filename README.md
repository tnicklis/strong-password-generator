# Strong Password Generator

## Description
This web application is designed to create a strong password to reduce a user's risk of being hacked or having sensitive information stolen. Since every online account requires different strong password parameters, this applicaiton will ask the user which types of characters should be included. 

## Installation 
You can view this code by exploring the files on GitHub or pulling them into VS Code via Git in the CLI.

## Usage 
You can use this webpage to generate a random strong password by clicking the red 'Generate Password' button. The box will then populate with a strong password. Then simply copy and paste your password to use it!
